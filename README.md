## Overview

This lab uses various sorting algorithms as examples several features
of [the Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/):

- [Arrays](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#the-array-type)
- [Slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-03-slices.html#other-slices)
- [Borrowing and ownership](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)
- [Generic types and traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-00-generics.html)

Here we've provided you with a sample Rust implementation of insertion sort, and
you'll implement two other common sorting algorithms:

- Quicksort
- Merge sort

Insertion sort and quicksort can be done "in place", so they take a
_mutable_ array of values and destructively sort the given array.

Merge sort can't be done "in place" ([it
requires allocation of additional storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#Variants)),
so it is structured here to return a new `Vec` as its result.

There are _lots_ of comments in the code on the various algorithms, but
you might want to look them up in your favorite source if you're rusty
(ho, ho) on those sorting algorithms.

Since you've dealt (at least a little) with arrays, slices, borrowing,
and ownership in the
[Disemvowel in Rust lab](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-Systems/disemvowel-in-rust)
we won't discuss them here, but we will say a little about traits.

## Traits

Rust uses the concept of _traits_ in a manner that is somewhat similar
to interfaces in Java. A trait in Rust indicates a set of properties that
a given type must have. A simplified signature for `insertion_sort`, for
example, is:

```rust
    fn insertion_sort<T: PartialOrd>(v: &mut [T])
```

Here `insertion_sort` takes a single parameter `v` that is an array of items
of type `T`. Now because we want to sort the items in the array, we need to
be able to ask "less-than" questions about items of type `T`. That ability
is provided by the trait `PartialOrd`. The annotation `<T: PartialOrd>` says
that `T` can't just be _any_ type â€“ it must implement
[the `PartialOrd` trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html),
which ensures support for useful things like `<` and `<=`, which we'll clearly
need to sort.

You can require a type to have several traits, joining them together with the
`+` operator like this:

```rust
    fn insertion_sort<T: PartialOrd + std::fmt::Debug>(v: &mut [T])
```

This is the actual signature for `insertion_sort` in the sample code, and says
that `T` has to support _two_ traits: `PartialOrd` and
[`Debug`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html). (The ability
to support multiple traits in Rust is similar to the ability to
implement multiple interfaces in Java.) The `Debug` trait allows you to
print data using the `{:?}` format, which generates output in a
programmer-friendly manner that is hopefully useful for debugging. We
don't _need_ this here (the code you're given doesn't actually use it),
but it might be helpful if you want/need to add some printing to debug
things as you're working on your implementation.

Lastly, one consequence of merge sort returning a new vector (instead of
sorting the array in place) is that it requires the ability to *copy*
elements from the input array into the output vector. Insertion sort and
quicksort don't need that because they can use the `.swap()` method on arrays
(which essentially swaps pointers on non-primitives instead of copying them).

This requires the addition of yet another trait [(`Copy`)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html)
to `T` in the signature of `merge_sort`:

```rust
    fn merge_sort<T: PartialOrd + std::marker::Copy + std::fmt::Debug>(v: &[T]) -> Vec<T>
```

Adding this trait allows us to perform actions that require copying such as:

```rust
    result.push(v[i])
```

Luckily integers (which is all we use here) already implement both the
`PartialOrd` and the `Copy` traits, so we're good to go. If we needed to
sort something more complex (like an array of student records), then we'd
have to decide

- How to implement the `PartialOrd` trait, perhaps by sorting by ID
  numbers, or we could be brave and attempt some sort of sorting by
  name.
- If and how we are willing to implement the `Copy` trait. As a rule
  we probably don't want to copy entire student records, so we'd have
  to figure out what makes sense in our particular situation.

## Running the code and the tests

This is set up so that running the program (with `cargo run`) will run and
time all three sorting algorithms on a randomly generated array of integers.
Since insertion sort is O(N^2) and the other two are O(N log N), we would
expect them to be faster. We might also expect quicksort to be faster (by
a constant factor) than merge sort since quicksort doesn't need to copy
elements around. Feel free to increase the value of the `size` constant
at the top of the code to see how that affects the timing.

Use `cargo test` to run the tests "by hand". The insertion sort tests
should pass without you having to do anything. Some of the quicksort
and merge sort tests may pass initially "for free" even though you know
you haven't actually implemented anything. This is just because the
default "silly" things that we do for those happen to be correct for
things like empty lists of values.

When running either the program or the tests, you'll initially get a
warning like:

```text
warning: unused variable: `ys`
   --> src/main.rs:171:75
    |
171 | fn merge<T: PartialOrd + std::marker::Copy + std::fmt::Debug>(xs: Vec<T>, ys: Vec<T>) -> Vec<T> {
    |                                                                           ^^ help: if this is intentional, prefix it with an underscore: `_ys`
    |
    = note: `#[warn(unused_variables)]` on by default
```

This is just telling you that the stub code that we provided doesn't use the
parameter `ys`. As you properly implement `merge()` you'll presumably use
both arguments and this warning will go away.

## To Do

The canvas rubric provides detailed information on how you will be graded. The
provided tests (which you can run with `cargo test`) should provide some
reasonable feedback on the correctness of your solution, but passing the tests
never guarantees _complete_ correctness. The badge at the top of this README
should also indicate whether your tests are passing in GitHub Actions.

- [ ] Implement `quicksort`
- [ ] Implement `merge sort`
- [ ] Ensure that the tests pass
- [ ] Code and commits should be understandable and useful
